= LDAP Authentication Setup for {productname}

The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an open,
vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and
maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet
Protocol (IP) network. {productname} supports using LDAP as an
identity provider.

[[quay-ldap-prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

The {productname} LDAP setup workflow requires that the user
configuring the LDAP Setup already exist in the LDAP directory. Before attempting
the setup, make sure that you are logged in as a superuser that matches
user credentials in LDAP. In order to do so, navigate to the SuperUser
panel (ex: https://quay.enterprise/superuser) and click on the “Create
User” button to create a new User. Make sure to create a user that
matches the username/email syntax in LDAP.

Once the user is created, modify the `config.yaml` file used to start {productname}
by adding the newly created user under the SUPER_USERS attribute, as follows:

```
SUPER_USERS:
- dgangaia
- testAdmin

```

For ease of troubleshooting, set the User password to the LDAP password.

Restart the {productname} container with the updated config.yaml
and log in to the Superuser panel as the user that was just created.

[[few-tips-for-ldap-configuration]]
== Tips for LDAP configuration:

* LDAP URI must be in ldap:// or ldaps:// syntax. Typing a URI with
ldaps:// prefix will surface the option to provide custom SSL
certificate for TLS setup
* User Relative DN is relative to BaseDN (ex: ou=NYC not
ou=NYC,dc=example,dc=org)
* Logged in Username must exist in User Relative DN
* You can enter multiple “Secondary User Relative DNs” if there are
multiple Organizational Units where User objects are located at. (ex:
ou=Users,ou=NYC and ou=Users,ou=SFO). Simply type in the Organizational
Units and click on Add button to add multiple RDNs
* sAMAccountName is the UID attribute for against Microsoft Active
Directory setups
* {productname} searches "User Relative DN" with subtree scope. For
example, if your Organization has Organizational Units NYC and SFO under
the Users OU (`ou=SFO,ou=Users and ou=NYC,ou=Users`), {productname} 
can authenticate users from both the NYC and SFO Organizational Units if
the User Relative DN is set to Users (ou=Users)

Once the configuration is completed, click on “Save Configuration
Changes” button to validate the configuration.

You will be prompted to login with *_LDAP
credentials_*.

[[common-issues]]
== Common Issues

*_Invalid credentials_*

Administrator DN or Administrator DN Password values are incorrect

*_Verification of superuser %USERNAME% failed: Username not found The
user either does not exist in the remote authentication system OR LDAP
auth is misconfigured._*

{productname} can connect to the LDAP server via Username/Password specified in
the Administrator DN fields however cannot find the current logged in
user with the UID Attribute or Mail Attribute fields in the User
Relative DN Path. Either current logged in user does not exist in User
Relative DN Path, or Administrator DN user do not have rights to
search/read this LDAP path.
